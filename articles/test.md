# Sample Markdown

This is some basic, sample markdown.

## Second Heading

- Unordered lists, and:

1.  One
2.  Two
3.  Three

- More

> Blockquote

And **bold**, _italics_, and even _italics_ and later **bold**. Even ~~strikethrough~~. [A link](https://markdowntohtml.com) to somewhere.

And code highlighting:

```js
var foo = "bar";

function baz(s) {
  return foo + ":" + s;
}
```

Or inline code like `var foo = 'bar';`.

Or an image of bears

The end ...
