# Introduction

I am a software engineer who wants to share his thoughts that hopefully go further than todayâ€™s ethos, which I feel like would best be described as _Panem et circenses_.

I am dissatisfied with the current state of the world, but that will never be a reason to just complain or to merely vent out negativity onto others. What one says or writes should have the motivation of providing value or promoting a worthy idea.

I believe that each one of us has an impact on the mentality of others, so join me in my effort to create a new Web free of social media and the influence of unethical entities.
