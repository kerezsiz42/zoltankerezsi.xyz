# Sample Markdown

This is some basic, sample markdown.

## Second Heading

- Unordered lists, and:

1.  One
2.  Two
3.  Three

- More

> <p>Words can be like X-rays, if you use them properly they’ll go through anything. You read and you’re pierced.</p>
> <footer>--Aldous Huxley, <cite>Brave New World</cite></footer>

And **bold**, _italics_, and even _italics_ and later **bold**. Even ~~strikethrough~~. [A link](https://markdowntohtml.com) to somewhere.

And code highlighting:

```js
var foo = "bar";

function baz(s) {
  return foo + ":" + s;
}
```

Or inline code like `var foo = 'bar';`.

Or an image of bears

![An image of a bear](http://placebear.com/200/200)

The end ...
